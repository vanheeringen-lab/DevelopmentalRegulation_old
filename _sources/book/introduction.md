# Introduction

## Before you start

The lectures (including the slides and recordings) in combination with this document should contain all information necessary to complete the exercises. However, there are many excellent reference books available on-line. Many of these can also be ordered in printed form if you find that convenient. 

Some suggested resources are listed here, in no particular order:

* [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/)
* [Python for Biologists tutorial](https://pythonforbiologists.com/introduction/)
* [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e)
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/)


## What you need to get up and running

Python comes in two major versions, Python 2 and 3. This course will use Python 3. The switch from Python 2 to 3 has taken a long time, therefore you might still find many Python 2 materials and examples on-line. However, since this year, Python 2 will not be supported anymore. Pretty much all important scientific libraries have also announced the end of support for Python 2.
